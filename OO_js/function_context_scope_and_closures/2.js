/*
The method franchise.allMovies is supposed to return the following array:

[
  'How to Train Your Dragon 1',
  'How to Train Your Dragon 2',
  'How to Train Your Dragon 3'
]
Explain why this method will not return the desired object? Try fixing this problem by taking advantage of JavaScript lexical scoping rules.

var franchise = {
  name: 'How to Train Your Dragon',
  allMovies: function() {
    return [1, 2, 3].map(function(number) {
      return this.name + ' ' + number;
    });
  },
};

This does not return the desired result because the anon function passed into map() loses the object's execution context. To resolve this problem with lexical scope, we can store the object's context in a local variable and have the anon function reference that local variable

var franchise = {
  name: 'How to Train Your Dragon',
  allMovies: function() {
    var self = this;
    return [1, 2, 3].map(function(number) {
      return self.name + ' ' + number;
    });
  },
};

console.log(franchise.allMovies());
