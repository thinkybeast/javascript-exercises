// The oddities function takes an array as an argument and returns a new array containing every other element from the input array. The values in the returned array are the first (index 0), third, fifth, and so on, elements of the input array. The program below uses the array returned by oddities as part of a comparison. Can you explain the results of these comparisons?

// Examples:

function oddities(array) {
  var oddElements = [];
  var i;

  for (i = 0; i < array.length; i += 2) {
    oddElements.push(array[i]);
  }

  return oddElements;
}

oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) === [2, 4, 6];      // false
oddities(['abc', 'def']) === ['abc'];         // false

// Explanation:

// The comparisons evaluate to false because in Javascript, strict equality comparison evaluate to true only when both sides point to the same object in memory. In this case, while the values in the returned array and the comparison are the same, they are different objects, and thus the comparison returns false.
